Not dissimilar to a stool one might see in night markets and sidewalk restaurants. Made from a single piece of galvanized sheet steel, laser cut, folded, and bolted together. The stool is the result of utilitarian simplicity. The stools stack for storage and are suitable for indoor and outdoor use.
