68 Claremont is a 6000 sqft warehouse conversion in downtown Toronto. The former sewing floor is now home to Free Space, a multi-use platform for video and photo production, events, office and gallery space.

The conversion had to make use of the existing floor plan while creating new partitions for the gallery, offices, photo studio and editing suites. The program uses a drapery track system to maintain a flexible floor plan that responds to different scenarios. An open floor plan is intended to leave the natural light unobstructed in order to shoot around the entire studio.

Materials included are raw pine, douglas fir plywood and galvanized steel. The floor is divided between an exposed subfloor and plywood covering to denote drop-in and fixed workspace. The space is also host to the Canon Creator Lab, an event space for Canon Cameras.
