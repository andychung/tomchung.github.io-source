Cast Pendants take inspiration from the traditional plumb weight &#8212; a weight hanging from a line used by masons and carpenters since Ancient Egypt to establish a true vertical. An honest light, the cast aluminum bodies are designed to be used as single pendants or in cluster configurations.

The use of LED technology allows for a surprisingly small scale, each light only measures 10-13cm tall. The collection suits both commercial and residential use. The lamp is available in three variations, and a splitter allows for variety of configurations.
