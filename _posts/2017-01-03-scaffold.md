Scaffold is a versatile occasional table which can be used in multiples to create low or high shelving. The flat pack powder coated steel construction easily assembles from a kit of parts using a 1/16th" allen key. The airy frame and planar volumes easily move around a small space to provide display shelving and can be re-configured when needed.
