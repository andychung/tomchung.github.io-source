Fromme borrows from the materials and principals of early 90's mountain biking, as well as off road vehicles and ultra light camping gear. The aluminum chair was designed to create a light weight and tilt responsive seat, contrasted with an entirely rigid material construction. The seat pan is mounted to the central frame using high load polymer compression springs fastened with ball joint connectors. 4 points of even compression allow the sitter to gently tilt back and forth in order to readjust pressure points.

With a fully knockdown construction, easy to clean anodized finish and stacking clearance; Fromme has been designed for high performance in indoor and outdoor contract environments.
