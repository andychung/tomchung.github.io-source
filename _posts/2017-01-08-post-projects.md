I was approached by long term collaborators and friends Post Projects to re-design their second floor office. Situated in the Mount Pleasant neighbourhood of Vancouver, BC. The industrial space was formerly two units, a print shop and bicycle co-op, which had been previously renovated to become one large unit shared between friends. The team has occupied the space since university and it has organically evolved from an informal shared space to an established Graphic Design office.

Having never addressed these new demands, the goal was to accommodate their list of growing requirements; an open floor plan to accommodate their hands on work, a space to host informal team meetings, a large open space for photography and a formal entryway to receive clients. Due to the studio's dedication to traditional analog mediums, lots of closed storage was created in order equipment for printmaking, photography and samples.

In order to emphasize the studio's hands on contemporary approach, graphic furniture was paired with paired back custom oak millwork and a tailor made polished stainless steel lighting system. A large graphic designed by the studio themselves was created from a cyanotype experiment and used as a background to the entry space. The key clamps which are used throughout the space are used to divide the formal work area from the library and kitchenette without closing off the natural light. Materials have been chosen to be neutral and institutional as a backdrop for the bold and graphic works in progress.
