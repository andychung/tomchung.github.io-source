Situated in the basement level of a Yorkville storefront, we designed the lower level of the new <a href="http://shopneighbour.com">Neighbour</a> Toronto location. The challenges of the space included 77" ceiling heights, exposed pipes and columns, storage doors and an asymmetrical floor plan. Embracing the irregularities as a starting point, the space was designed to feel warm and informal.
