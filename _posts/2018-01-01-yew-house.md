Yew House is situated on a small corner lot in Kitsilano, one of Vancouver's original working class neighbourhoods. Originally built in 1910, the house has undergone a patchwork of renovations with most of its land being sold off to accommodate a neighbouring development in the 1970's. Due to the sale of this land it is now impossible to build a new house of the same size on the lot. Following these zoning restrictions, the existing house was upgraded by gutting it down to the studs, re-insulating and seismically upgrading the timber shell.

Finishes were kept hardwearing and timeless throughout. The floors, including the stairs, are European White Oak. The millwork is a combination of Oak and Baltic Birch. During the demolition, an original fire place was discovered hidden behind drywall. It was restored and helps to define the dining and living areas.
