High Beam is an adjustable desk or shelf light that offers a wide variety of lighting possibilities. The name, an automotive reference, and function is inspired by the multiple light settings on all modern cars. The simple form is taken from headlight details while aiming to provide the flexibility of a task light within a smaller compact housing. 

Two LED light sources set at 57 degrees are controlled from a central two way dimming switch, while a slip ring in the base offers 360 degree rotation.
