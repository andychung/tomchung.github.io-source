Beam is a versatile table lamp with a modern expression and intuitive user-friendliness. With light shone from both ends of a cylinder shape, the user can choose between three different volumes of light and gradually alter the volume of light omitted in each end through the turn of a playful dial. The Beam Lamp can be altered for any position with its rotating base and sleek body of anodized aluminum, whether it be as direct lighting or for an ambient glow in any home, offices, hotel room and educational areas.
