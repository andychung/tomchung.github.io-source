Piton is a smart lamp which takes its name from the climbing apparatus. Similarly, the lamp may be combined with other tools, such as rope, hooks, clips or straps, to be rigged in various positions. An LED light source and acrylic diffuser allow a focused direct spotlight as well as ambient indirect lighting depending on the orientation. A steel counterweight
in the handle lets the lamp rest in a multitude of sturdy positions, while a rechargeable
USB power source maintains mobility.
