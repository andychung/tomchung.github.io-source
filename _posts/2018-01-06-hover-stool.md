Hover is a contemporary take on the mechanics stool. Designed for co-working spaces or cafe's where one might need personal short term storage space. 

The tray provides a surface for your bag, without having to place it on the floor or hanger. Wheels add mobility to comfortably shift in place. The entire assembly is knock down and easily slotted together.

At home, the stool may be used as a side table, extra seat, or storage cart.
