A jewellery and accessories showroom located on the second floor of an office building on King St West. The space was designed to feel timeless, maximal and elegant while assimilating with the offices which occupy the same floor.

A neutral palette was selected in order to display a contemporary selection of brands. The space acts as a office, showroom and retail space with a residential feeling.
